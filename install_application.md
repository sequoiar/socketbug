#Installing Socketbug - The Application

With the Socketbug Server up and running, it's time to connect your Mobile Web Application.

To do this you will need to install the Client Side code.  This can be on the same machine that has your server running on it, but it certainly does not have to be.

The purpose of the Client Application code is for your Mobile Web Applications to have a place to connect to a central location that will handle communication with the Socketbug Server... which may very well be located on a completely different server.  How you set this up is entirely up to you.

If you have not already setup your Socketbug Server, you should [do this first](http://manifestinteractive.github.com/socketbug/install_server.html).
